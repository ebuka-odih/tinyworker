# Plans

This folder contains implementation plans used for multi-agent execution.

- `PROJECT_PLAN.md` is the top-level product plan.
- Each plan in `docs/plans/` should follow the swarm-ready template:
  - task IDs (T1…)
  - `depends_on: []`
  - acceptance criteria
  - validation steps

See: `docs/llmjunky-concept/PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`
